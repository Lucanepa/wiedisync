# Permissions reference — KSCW Directus

Canonical role × collection × action map. Reflects the live state through migration 052 (2026-05-12). Updated by reviewers as part of every permission change.

> **2026-05-12 — Deep-audit LEADER tightening.** Removed unfiltered LEADER reads on `members`, `participations`, `absences`, `user_logs`, and unfiltered LEADER updates on `games`, `trainings`, `events`. All now use the coach/TR-of-the-target-team filter pattern; `members.read` adds a `LEADER_TEAM_MEMBER_FIELDS` whitelist that excludes `ahv_nummer`. LEADER lost `user_logs.read` entirely — audit access goes through `/kscw/admin/audit` (admin-only). See SECURITY.md "2026-05-12" block for the full per-finding ledger.

> **Source of truth (post-2026-05-06):** `directus/scripts/setup-permissions.mjs` is the SINGLE source for Directus permissions. It is declarative, idempotent (clears + recreates on every run), and applied via `npm run db:setup-perms:<env>` on every deploy. Numbered SQL migrations are SCHEMA-ONLY going forward — they no longer carry permission rows. This doc is the human-readable index of the script — keep both in sync.

> **Permissions migrations 019/020/023/024/025/026/027/029/030/032/033/034/035/036/042/043** in `0NN-*.sql` form the historical journal of how we got to the current state. Do not write new ones. Update the script instead and let `db:setup-perms` reconcile.

## Roles & policies

| Role | Policy | `admin_access` | `app_access` | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Administrator | (built-in) | true | true | Directus root |
| Superuser | KSCW Admin | true | true | Full system access (superuser + admin members) |
| Sport Admin | KSCW Sport Admin | false | true | vb_admin / bb_admin — sport-scoped club ops |
| Vorstand | KSCW Vorstand | false | true | Board members — read-all access |
| Team Responsible | KSCW Team Responsible | false | true | Coach or team responsible (LEADER tier) |
| Member | KSCW Member | false | true | Default authenticated member |
| Public | (built-in `$t:public_label`) | false | true | Unauthenticated visitors |

Inheritance (additive): `Sport Admin` → `Team Responsible` → `Member`. `Vorstand` → `Member`. Every member of a higher tier carries the lower tier's permissions on top of their own row.

## Filter shorthand

Used throughout — repeated literally rather than via subqueries because Directus stores filters as inline JSON.

| Name | Filter | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `OWN_USER` | `{ user: { _eq: '$CURRENT_USER' } }` | members directly |
| `OWN_MEMBER` | `{ member: { user: { _eq: '$CURRENT_USER' } } }` | rows with `member` FK |
| `OWN_DU` | `{ user: { user: { _eq: '$CURRENT_USER' } } }` | `user_logs` (int FK to members) |
| `MY_TEAMS` | `{ team: { members: { member: { user: ... } } } }` | trainings, anything team-scoped |
| `EVENTS_VISIBLE` | `_or` of own / club-wide / my-teams / invited-members | events, event_sessions, events_members |
| `SAME_TEAM_AS_ME` | `_or` of own member + member-on-same-team | participations, absences |
| `OWN_DELEGATION` | `{ _or: [{ from_member.user }, { to_member.user }] }` | scorer_delegations |

---

## KSCW Member — most-touched rows

| polls | `MY_TEAMS` (via team)| `*` | 035 |
| referee_expenses | `MY_TEAMS` (via team) | `*` | 035 |

### Reads (intentionally cross-club)

`teams`, `games`, `rankings`, `sponsors`, `event_sessions` (read filtered above), `hall_slots`, `hall_closures`, `hall_events`, `hall_events_halls`, `halls`, `hall_slots_teams`, `slot_claims`, `news`, `app_settings`, `carpools`, `carpool_passengers`, `teams_coaches`, `teams_responsibles`, `teams_sponsors`, `events_teams`, `events_members`, `directus_files`.

### Writes

| Collection | Action | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| members | update | `OWN_USER`, fields = `MEMBER_EDITABLE_FIELDS` (excludes `role`, role stripped by hook filter) |
| participations | create / update | own |
| absences | create / update / delete | own |
| notifications | update / delete | own |
| push_subscriptions | create / update / delete | own |
| scorer_delegations | create / update | own (from/to) |
| user_logs | create | none |
| feedback | create | none |
| tasks | update | own (assigned/claimed) |
| carpools | create / update | own driver |
| carpool_passengers | create / update | own |
| poll_votes | create / update | `OWN_MEMBER` |
| team_requests | create | none |
| directus_files | create | none |

**Explicit non-write for Member:** `members.role` field — stripped by `filter('members.items.update')` in `kscw-hooks` for non-admin callers (defense-in-depth on top of field-level perm).

## KSCW Vorstand

Inherits Member. Adds read-all on operational collections — board oversight role:

`members, member_teams, participations, absences, notifications, scorer_delegations, team_invites, user_logs, feedback, tasks, task_templates, poll_votes, team_requests, push_subscriptions, game_scheduling_*, announcements`.

No CRU writes — Vorstand is read-only by design.

---

## KSCW Sport Admin

Inherits Team Responsible (and via that, Member). Adds full CRUD on operational collections except:

- `members` and `teams` — create / read / update only. **No delete** (migration 027 — club-wide blast radius is admin-only).

---

## Administrator / Superuser

`admin_access = true`. Bypasses all permission checks. Use sparingly.

---

## Operational checklist for permission changes

When you touch any permission row:

- [ ] Edit `directus/scripts/setup-permissions.mjs` only. **Do NOT write a numbered SQL migration for a permission change.**
- [ ] Update this `PERMISSIONS.md` row in the same commit.
- [ ] Add a one-liner to `SECURITY.md` audit log (`### YYYY-MM-DD — …`).
- [ ] Test: `npm run db:deploy:dev` — runs migrate → setup-perms → smoke. Confirm green before merging.
- [ ] Ship: merge to prod and `npm run db:deploy:prod`.

The reviewer should diff `setup-permissions.mjs` against this doc to confirm parity. The smoke test is the safety net — if it fails for a Member role on any collection, the deploy halts before reaching users.

---

## Verification queries

Run these after migration 043 to confirm parity:

```sql
-- 1. Critical reads scoped
SELECT pol.name, p.collection, p.action, p.permissions, p.fields
FROM directus_permissions p
JOIN directus_policies pol ON pol.id = p.policy
WHERE p.collection IN ('sv_vm_check','tasks','feedback','member_teams')
  AND pol.name = 'KSCW Member'
ORDER BY p.collection;

-- 2. teams.update is row-scoped for both leader sub-policies
SELECT pol.name, p.collection, p.action, p.permissions
FROM directus_permissions p
JOIN directus_policies pol ON pol.id = p.policy
WHERE p.collection = 'teams' AND p.action = 'update';

-- 3. Sport Admin: no delete on members or teams
SELECT pol.name, p.collection, p.action
FROM directus_permissions p
JOIN directus_policies pol ON pol.id = p.policy
WHERE pol.name = 'KSCW Sport Admin' AND p.collection IN ('members','teams')
ORDER BY p.collection, p.action;

-- 4. teams_sponsors FK present + cascade
SELECT conname, confdeltype FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'teams_sponsors'::regclass AND contype = 'f';

-- 5. Messaging functions have search_path
SELECT proname, proconfig FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname LIKE 'fn_messaging%' OR proname = 'messaging_protect_sentinel'
ORDER BY proname;

-- 6. anon / authenticated have NO SELECT on operational tables
SELECT grantee, table_name
FROM information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND grantee IN ('anon','authenticated')
  AND privilege_type = 'SELECT'
ORDER BY table_name;
-- Expected: empty (or only the explicitly-public set).
```
