 * Map a ManualGameInput from the modal/import flow to the flat `games` row
 * payload Directus expects. Handles:
 *   - generating a unique game_id (`manual_<uuid>`)
 *   - setting source + status + nulling svrz_push_status
 *   - deriving home_team / away_team from the chosen team name + opponent
 *   - routing hall vs away_hall_json based on type
 *
 * The caller MUST pass `kscwTeamName` separately since `games.home_team` and
 * `games.away_team` are text columns, not relations.
